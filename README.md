### Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

#### Capstone Project
##### Starbucks mobile app project

#### Introduction
The Starbucks mobile app capstone project is the final capstone project in udacity [machine learning engineer nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t).

The purpose of this capstone project is prediction of successful coupon or advertisement offer to customers by using machine learning technique.

Datasets are distributed from udacity.

Data analysis, preprocessing, model training, prediction have done in each jupyter notebooks.
